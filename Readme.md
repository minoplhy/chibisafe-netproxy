# Chibisafe Network Storage Middleman

how to use this repo?
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minoplhy/chibisafe_netstorage_middleman && cd chibisafe_netstorage_middleman
docker compose up -d
```
should be just fine :D

~PS.because the whole project was written within 8â€“10 hours, so the code might look a bit messy. I'll clean things up when I have time.
